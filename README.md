# 👋 Hi there! I'm Manula Vishvajith

A passionate Software Engineer and a Finance Specialist. With a background in finance and a heart drawn to creation, I’ve always been fascinated by how software — though invisible in form — can shape the world in profoundly tangible ways.

To me, software is modern alchemy: abstract lines of logic turning into living systems that solve real problems. It’s not just about code — it’s about **bringing ideas to life**, building invisible bridges between imagination and impact.

I believe you don’t need to follow a conventional path to be an engineer. You only need the drive to understand, to build, and to make things better - and that’s what fuels my journey every day.

## 🚀 Tech Stack & Interests

**Languages & Frameworks**
- 🐍 Python - A truly versatile language (albeit with some challenges), it has immense value in AI/ML Developments, Backend and Data Analytics
- 💙 GoLang - I have dabbled in using GoLang being interested in the language due to its efficiency, you can see a few public projects I have done on this.
- ⚡ JavaScript & TypeScript (React, Next.js, NestJS) 
- 📱 Flutter
- Other interests - in some time I aim to explore the value of Rust as a language, I believe memory safe development in low-level development is an absolute must and world will take up Rust or equivalents in the future.

**Databases & Storage**
- PostgreSQL, MySQL
- MongoDB, Firebase

**Cloud & DevOps**
- AWS 
- Azure
- GCP 

**GenAI Integrations**
- OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI

## 📈 Projects & Contributions

## 🌐 Public Projects

My public projects reflect my passion and contributions to the community. Enjoy!

## 🔒 Private Projects

While most of my work is under private repositories due to client confidentiality, here's a summary:

- 🧠 9+ applications developed using Flutter, React, NestJS, and Python
- 🤖 Integrated GenAI models (OpenAI, Bedrock, Vertex AI) into real-world products
- 🌐 2 production web apps deployed
- 🔐 Many repositories are private, but I’m happy to share specific examples privately on request (under NDA if needed)
