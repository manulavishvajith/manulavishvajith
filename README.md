## 🔒 Private Projects

While most of my work is under private repositories due to client confidentiality, here's a summary:

- 🧠 9+ applications developed using Flutter, React, NestJS, and Python
- 🤖 Integrated GenAI models (OpenAI, Bedrock, Vertex AI) into real-world products
- 🌐 2 production web apps deployed
- 🔐 Many repositories are private, but I’m happy to share specific examples privately on request (under NDA if needed)

Thank you for reading
